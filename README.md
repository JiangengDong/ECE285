# ECE285

This repository is the code for our ECE285 final project. We search for the best architecture for object detection problem using DARTS and SGL.

A whole experiment consists of two parts. In the first part, we search for the best architecture on a small batch of data. In the second part, we fully optimize the architecture found by training on a large dataset.
